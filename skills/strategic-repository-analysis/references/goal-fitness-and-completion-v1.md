# Goal Fitness & Completion v1

**Status:** canonical reference for `strategic-repository-analysis`  
**Scope:** Level-3 objective/frontier integrity  
**Authority:** semantic guidance; never overrides explicit owner authority

## 1. Purpose

Strategic analysis must obey explicit owner intent **and** diagnose whether the
stated objective is a sound representation of the governing product intent.

This prevents **milestone inversion**:

```text
terminal product intent
-> instrumental milestone
-> verification/evidence surface

must not collapse into

verification/evidence surface
= terminal success
```

The Skill may surface mismatch. It may not silently replace the owner's goal.

## 2. Classify the objective role

When the distinction can change the Strategic Frontier, classify the stated
objective qualitatively as one of:

```text
terminal | milestone | proxy | constraint | evidence_state | unclear
```

- `terminal` — satisfying it directly realizes the governing outcome;
- `milestone` — a bounded intermediate state on the way to the governing outcome;
- `proxy` — an observable representation used to stand in for less directly
  measurable progress;
- `constraint` — a limit or invariant, not the desired end state;
- `evidence_state` — a qualification, validation, audit, or claim state;
- `unclear` — repository/owner evidence does not yet establish the relationship.

Do not infer a hidden “true goal” from vibes. Ground governing intent in explicit
owner direction, authoritative product strategy, current repository authority,
or another identified source.

```text
owner statement
!= permission to invent hidden intent

goal diagnosis
!= owner-goal replacement
```

## 3. Goal-fit test

Ask:

> If the stated objective were fully satisfied, could a material governing
> product objective still remain unsatisfied?

Search for a concrete counterexample in current evidence.

If no material counterexample exists, `GOAL_FIT = aligned` may be warranted.

If the stated objective advances the governing intent but does not establish it,
use `GOAL_FIT = partial`.

If satisfying the stated objective would materially pull work away from or
contradict the governing intent, use `GOAL_FIT = conflicting`.

If the relationship cannot yet be established from current evidence, use
`GOAL_FIT = unresolved`.

These are semantic descriptions, not schema enums or numeric scores.

## 4. Completion-layer sanity check

Use only the layers relevant to the domain. The generic pattern is:

```text
implementation exists
!= integration/reachability complete
!= content/behavior complete
!= intended user/product experience complete
!= release/qualification complete
```

Examples:

- a route may be reachable while its scenes remain materially unfinished;
- an API may exist while the end-to-end user workflow remains incomplete;
- a package may build while its required product behavior is still partial;
- a release candidate may be technically packageable while the intended product
  surface is not content/experience complete.

Do not demand subjective perfection. Establish only whether a decision-relevant
prerequisite state is `ESTABLISHED`, `PARTIAL`, `MISSING`,
`CLAIMED_UNVERIFIED`, or otherwise represented in the existing capability
model.

## 5. Difference-closing frontier

When the governing target state is explicit, prefer a frontier question that
compares current reality to that target instead of merely optimizing a state
label:

```text
What is the highest-value remaining material difference
between the current product/system state
and the authoritative target state?
```

Then:

```text
close one warranted difference
-> reconcile returned evidence
-> reassess the next material difference
-> stop when no further warranted difference remains
```

This is not “keep improving forever.” The target state, evidence ceilings,
authority, and stop conditions remain bounded by governing intent.

## 5A. Closed-world completion during terminalization

The difference-closing frontier above applies while the product/repository
future is materially open. When authoritative repository state declares a
version scope frozen/terminalizing and Level 3 is `NO_CHANGE` with no active
construction responsibility, change the burden of proof.

Do not compare the current product against an unconstrained ideal product or
interpret "finished" as "no further improvement can be imagined." Compare only
against the authoritative frozen target.

Admit new current-version work only when positive evidence maps it to:

- an unsatisfied frozen requirement or support obligation;
- a reproducible defect violating that obligation;
- incomplete required integration/reachability;
- a mandatory release-gate failure; or
- explicit owner scope expansion.

```text
desirable improvement != release blocker
architectural refinement != incomplete product
taxonomy inconsistency != construction gap by default
new strategic hypothesis != reopened frozen scope
```

A terminal `NO_CHANGE` state therefore changes work admission:

```text
open product evolution
-> plausible material opportunity may enter the frontier

closed version terminalization
-> positive blocker evidence is required to reopen current-version construction
```

Do not add a new completion schema merely to represent this distinction; use
the existing governing intent, status, capability, frontier, and release
surfaces.

## 6. Legibility bias

Mechanically legible work can dominate agent attention even when it is not the
highest-value frontier.

Examples include:

- CI checks;
- exact SHAs;
- validators;
- package/release metadata;
- test counts;
- deployment state.

Less mechanically legible product work may include:

- content completeness;
- experiential continuity;
- narrative/presentation finality;
- workflow usability;
- qualitative fit to an explicit product promise.

```text
easy to verify
!= strategically important

harder to inspect semantically
!= safe to ignore
```

Do not lower evidence standards. Ensure the Strategic Frontier represents the
governing mission rather than merely the most machine-legible evidence surface.

## 7. Goal-fit warning

When material mismatch exists, surface it explicitly:

```text
GOAL_FIT_WARNING

stated objective:
<explicit owner objective>

objective role:
<milestone/proxy/etc.>

governing intent:
<grounded product intent>

counterexample:
<how the stated objective could be satisfied while governing intent remains unmet>

optimization risk:
<what work the milestone may preferentially attract>

frontier consequence:
<what strategic question must be represented before converging>
```

This warning is semantic guidance. It does not require a new artifact schema.

## 8. Handoff to path synthesis

After goal fitness and completion layers are established:

1. form the Strategic Frontier from the governing mission;
2. run Strategic Hypothesis Admission;
3. generate coherent paths;
4. run the orthogonality challenge in
   `construction-path-synthesis-v1.md`;
5. compare only the materially real path set.

A downstream milestone may remain a valid path. It simply may not monopolize the
decision space when an upstream product-completion frontier remains materially
unresolved.

## 9. Anti-patterns

Do not:

- treat an owner-supplied milestone as automatically terminal;
- infer a hidden owner goal without evidence;
- equate route/build/package/test completion with product completion;
- prefer qualification merely because its evidence is more legible;
- reopen a settled terminal objective merely because a proxy is imperfect;
- manufacture an orthogonal path solely to create option diversity;
- create a new completion schema when the existing capability/frontier model is sufficient.
