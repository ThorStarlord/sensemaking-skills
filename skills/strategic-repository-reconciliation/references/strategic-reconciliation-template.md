# Strategic Reconciliation

## 1. Prior Decision and Scope

Identify the target repository, prior analysis reference, prior selected path if
any, and the decision/responsibility that produced the returned evidence.

## 2. Returned Evidence

List decision-relevant returned evidence and provenance.

## 3. Claim Updates

For each material prior claim: `CONFIRM | REVISE | RETRACT | UNCHANGED`.

## 4. Assumption Updates

For each material prior assumption: `CONFIRM | RESOLVE | REVISE | INVALIDATE |
UNCHANGED`.

## 5. Path Continuation

Declare `CONTINUE | REVISE | SUPERSEDE | CLOSE | NO_PATH_CHANGE` and explain.

## 6. Strategic Implication

Declare exactly one:
`NO_MODEL_CHANGE | REAFFIRM | REVISE_STRATEGY | REOPEN_ANALYSIS |
OWNER_DECISION | THESIS_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.

## 7. Authority and Claim Boundaries

State what remains unauthorized/reserved.

## 8. Evidence

List stable references.

## 9. Machine-Readable Summary
