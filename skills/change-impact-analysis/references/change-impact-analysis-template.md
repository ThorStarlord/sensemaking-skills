# Change Impact Analysis

## 1. Change, Scope, and Authority

State the bounded change, its state, target repository/source identity, and
authority boundary.

## 2. Impact Evidence

List evidence used to determine affected surfaces.

## 3. Affected Surfaces

For each decision-relevant surface include category, target, impact, evidence,
semantic review need, verification/reconciliation need, and authority boundary.

## 4. Cross-Repository Impact

List only explicitly selected repository impacts. State none when not applicable.

## 5. Claim and Verification Consequences

Explain what claims/verification/closure conditions change.

## 6. Bounded Follow-Up Responsibilities

List only follow-up work warranted by the impact evidence.

## 7. Closure Effect

Declare one:
`NO_CLOSURE_EFFECT | ADDITIONAL_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED |
RECONCILIATION_REQUIRED | OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED |
STRATEGIC_REASSESSMENT_REQUIRED | THESIS_REVIEW_REQUIRED`.

## 8. Authority and Claim Boundaries

State protected transitions and claim ceiling.
