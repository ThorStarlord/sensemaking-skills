# Lean Canvas methodology and business_canvas contract

**Methodological provenance:** adapted from `lucasgaravelli/pm-skills-claude-code@21cbb2903d740d10fc65c667aea97d3ee8657349`, `.claude/commands/lean-canvas.md`.

Retain Ash Maurya's nine blocks: problem, solution, unique value proposition, unfair advantage, customer segments, channels, revenue streams, cost structure, and key metrics. Treat the canvas as a hypothesis map rather than a business-plan truth source.

Produce sections: `## Canvas`, `## Evidence and assumptions`, `## Critical hypotheses`, `## Validation order`, `## Unknowns and limitations`, `## Machine-readable handoff`.

Allowed evidence states are `observed`, `inferred`, `hypothesis`, and `unknown`. Any block marked `observed` requires evidence refs. `status` is always `hypothesis` here; later empirical evidence may update Campaign knowledge without retroactively changing the meaning of this generated canvas.
